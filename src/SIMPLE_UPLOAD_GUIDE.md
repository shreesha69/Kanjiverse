# 📦 WHERE ARE MY FILES? - Simple Upload Guide

## 🔍 Your Files Are Here in Figma Make!

All the files you see on the left sidebar are your project files:
- App.tsx
- components/ folder
- data/ folder  
- styles/ folder
- package.json
- README.md
- etc.

## 🚀 EASIEST WAY: Download & Upload

### Step 1: Download Your Project

**Option A: If Figma Make has a "Download" button:**
1. Look for **"Download"** or **"Export"** button in Figma Make
2. Click it to download a ZIP file
3. Unzip the file on your computer
4. You'll see all your project files!

**Option B: If no download button:**
- Copy each file manually (see below)

---

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

#### Method 1: Upload ZIP File (EASIEST!)

1. Go to https://github.com
2. Create new repository: `kanji-ladder`
3. **Don't add README** (we already have one)
4. After creating, click **"uploading an existing file"**
5. **Drag your entire project folder** into the upload box
6. GitHub will upload ALL files at once!
7. Commit message: "Initial commit - Kanji Ladder"
8. Click **"Commit changes"**

✅ **DONE!**

---

#### Method 2: Manual File Upload (If you can't download)

1. Create GitHub repository
2. Click "Add file" → "Create new file"
3. For each file, create it manually:

**Example - Creating App.tsx:**
- File name: `App.tsx`
- Copy content from Figma Make
- Paste into GitHub
- Click "Commit changes"

**For folders:**
- File name: `components/Home.tsx` (GitHub auto-creates folders!)
- Copy content
- Commit

Repeat for all files... (tedious but works!)
